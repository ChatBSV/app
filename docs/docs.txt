///  Documentation: src/lib/getErrorMessage.js
Overview
getErrorMessage.js is a utility function in a JavaScript application that extracts and formats error messages from various error object structures.

Function: getErrorMessage
Purpose: To extract a user-friendly error message from an error object.
Parameters: Accepts an error object.
Implementation:
Checks if the provided error is an object.
Prioritizes extracting the message from error.response.data.message if available, which is a common structure in HTTP response errors.
If the above is not found, it falls back to error.message, which is standard for JavaScript errors.

Errors with a response object, common in HTTP requests (e.g., Axios).
Standard JavaScript errors with a message property.
Errors with a specific code.
Generic or unknown error structures.
Usage
This function is mainly used in error handling across the application, particularly in API routes and service functions, to provide consistent and clear error messaging.
It's especially useful in environments where multiple types of errors might occur, such as network requests, third-party library integrations, or general JavaScript exceptions.
Notes
The function is designed to be flexible and handle multiple error structures, which is common in applications interacting with various APIs and libraries.
The use of a utility function like this promotes consistency in error messaging throughout the application.
