with the correct spelling exactly as provided by user in Impact font, white fill, black stroke)

(3) craft a promt to dalle where:
- always compliant: instead of using names or characters like 'Dave Chappelle' or 'Master Yoda' , 
describe the characters traits to remain compliant with openai
- detailed: escribe the image in details so dalle can replicate very similar to original image
- always with the correct spelling extrcated from input
