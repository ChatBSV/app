Technical Documentation Brief
Overview
This project is a chat application built using Next.js, deployed on Vercel, and integrated with HandCash for payments using Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). It provides a chat interface where users can interact with GPT-4 or generate images using DALL-E, with each interaction incurring a cost.

Handoff Notes
The project is modular, with clear separation of concerns. Components are reusable and maintainable. Pay special attention to payment processing and error handling. The environment setup needs to be configured for HandCash API integration.

This documentation is intended for a software development team familiar with React, Next.js, and server-side JavaScript development. The focus should be on understanding the flow of data through hooks, state management in React components, and integration with external APIs (HandCash and GPT-4/DALL-E).
