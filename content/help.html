<h3 >2. How It Works</h3>
<strong>Using Commands:</strong>

To switch between models use the model name and number starting with /gpt or /dalle.

<code>/GPT 3</code> - Sets GPT-3.5 Turbo as the model.
<code>/GPT 4</code> - Sets GPT-4 as the model.

>Use "<strong>/GPT 4</strong>" to switch to GPT 4 and continue the conversation.

<code>/DALLE 2</code> - Sets DALL-E 2 as the model.
<code>/DALLE 3</code> - Sets DALL-E 3 as the model.

>Use "<strong>/DALLE 2</strong>" to set DALL-E 2 and then use /IMAGINE {Prompt} to generate an image with DALL-E 2.

<strong>Generating Media</strong>

Once you've set your preferred AI model, you can use commands like /IMAGINE and /MEME to generate content:

<code>/IMAGINE</code> - Generate images using AI. 

>Type "<strong>/IMAGINE</strong>" followed by a prompt describing your image.

<code>/MEME</code> - Create a unique AI generated meme.

>Type "<strong>/MEME</strong>" followed by a prompt describing your meme.

<strong>Image Formatting</strong>

You can further customize your outputs with optional formatting parameters:

/IMAGINE [prompt]
<code>--format 512</code> 
(Dimensions valid for DALL-E 2)

/IMAGINE [prompt] 
<code>--format horizontal</code> 
(Horizontal and vertical formats are valid for DALL-E 3)

>For example, type: 
"/imagine a futuristic city <strong>--format Vertical</strong>"

<strong>Text and Code Formatting</strong>

You can ask GPT to retun its response using <strong>Markdown</strong> for formatting.

>For example: "Using markdown, write an article about blockchain scalability."
